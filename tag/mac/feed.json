If you have more than one MAC and you start sharing things back and forth between your computers, the names of those MACs start to matter. </p>\n<p>On Mac OS X, changing computer name is extremely easy. How to change it? Just open up System Preferences, go to Sharing, and change the computer name. <img src=\"/2015/07/OS-X-System-Preferences.png\" alt=\"Os X System Preferences\"> You may need to change the name under your Network setting also. Open&#xA0;Network (next to Sharing), Advanced, WINS, and change the NetBIOS name. Done!</p>\n",
