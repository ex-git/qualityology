            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;Some old MacOS user may notice that installing Safari extention is not working like before in new system. &amp;#x201C;Install now&amp;#x201D; is no longer exist, it was replaced by &amp;#x201C;Trust&amp;#x201D;. However, when click the &amp;#x201C;Trust&amp;#x201D; button to install external extension, extension will not be installed in to Safari. That has nothing to do with the extension compatible issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like a bug on the &amp;#x201C;Trust&amp;#x201D; button. Mouse click on the &amp;#x201C;Trust&amp;#x201D; button is ignored. However, there is a trick to get this work. We can use keyboard to confirm the installation. Before that, we need to enable the keyboard control access in Windows and dialogs. For OS X 10.11.* or maybe later version if bug still exist. Go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Keyboard &amp;gt; Shortcuts &amp;gt; Full Keyboard Access, select &amp;#x201C;All controls&amp;#x201D;. Now we can press Tab key to move focus between button in Windows and dialogs. &lt;img src=&#34;/2016/04/osx-10.11-keyboard-all-controls.png&#34; alt=&#34;Osx 10.11 Keyboard All Controls&#34;&gt; Now try to install Safari extension, when the dialog pop up, do not use mouse to click the &amp;#x201C;Trust&amp;#x201D; button since it will not work, use keyboard instead. Press the &amp;#x201C;tab&amp;#x201D; key to move the focus to &amp;#x201C;Trust&amp;#x201D; button and hit space or return. Extension will be installed.&lt;/p&gt;
